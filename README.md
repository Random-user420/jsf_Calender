A random Calender with some German Labels, because I'm to lazy to translate that. Made with Primefaces for a Lerning Project.

### Important:
You'll need to have a running docker conainer or a database with mariadb(or you edit the driver and url to use other dbs). And you'll need to edit the username and password for your data base in src/main/resources/persistence.xml 

To-do:
Persistence,
Per User Kalender / login
